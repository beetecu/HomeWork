Multithread Hybrid System for String Pattern Matching (Aho-Corasick and Wu Manber)

/**
 * This is an implementation of the hybrid multiple pattern matching from
 * http://www.just.edu.jo/~munzer/MyPubs/Hybrid.pdf
 * <p>
 * The premise is to exploit the fact that WM is inefficient for
 * short strings and AC performance degrades for longer strings. 
 * 
 * According to the paper, the system best performance 
 * is achieved using 1 thread for the Aho-Corasick method
 * and 3 thread for the Wu-Manber method. The sequences
 * with size interval betweeen 1-7 are processed by the
 * Aho-Corasick and the ones > 7 by the Wu Manber
 *  
 *
 * NOTE: The Wu Manber method require to be optimazed
